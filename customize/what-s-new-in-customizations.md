<tr class="even">
<td><p>In Windows 10, version 1703, the Windows Provisioning Framework and the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer(WICD) no longer support design time customizations or generating customized images. </p></td>
<td><p>In Windows 10, version 1703, only runtime settings are available in WPF, and only provisioning packages are generated by the renamed Windows Configuration Designer. This means that Windows Configuration Designer is now a provisioning-only tool that supports ITPros and system administrators. For that reason, we have updated and moved the appropriate topics to TechNet. Please see [Windows Provisioning framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn898375) and [Provisioning packages for Windows 10](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/deploy/provisioning-packages).</p></td>

<td><p> See [Microsoft-Windows-TwinUI-Hide](desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-twinui-hide.md).</p></td>
