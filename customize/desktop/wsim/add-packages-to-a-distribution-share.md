# Add Packages to a Distribution Share


Packages are groups of files that Microsoft provides. These groups of files include service packs, security updates, language packs, and modifications to Windows® features. You can add a package to a Windows installation by using an answer file, a configuration set, or a distribution share.

You must use Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM) to import packages. After a package is imported and available in a distribution share, you can add the package to an answer file. For more information, see [Add a Package to an Answer File](add-a-package-to-an-answer-file.md).

**Note**  
For specific information about how to add language packs, see Add Multilingual Support to a Windows Distribution.

 

**To import a package to a distribution share**

1.  Select and open a distribution share. For more information, see [Create or Open a Distribution Share](create-or-open-a-distribution-share.md).

2.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Import Package(s)**.

    The **Select Package(s) to Import** window opens.

3.  Browse to the file or folder, select the file or folder, and then click **Open** or **Open Folder**.

    Windows SIM adds the selected package to the distribution-share folder. The newly added package is displayed under the **Packages** node in the **Distribution Share** pane.
