# Add a Custom Command to an Answer File


The following procedure describes how to configure a custom command to run automatically during Windows Setup. 

**To add a custom command to an answer file**

1.  Open Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM).

2.  Create or open an answer file. For more information, see [Create or Open an Answer File](create-or-open-an-answer-file.md).

3.  On the **Insert** menu, point to **Synchronous Command**, and then click a configuration pass on the submenu.

    The **Create Synchronous Command** dialog box opens.

4.  In the **Enter command line** box, type the command-line syntax. In the **Order** box, select the order of the commands that will run, and then click **OK**.

    The command is added to the answer file in the selected configuration pass, as follows:

    -   Commands that are added to the **1 windowsPE** configuration pass appear in the setting **Microsoft-Windows-Setup\\RunSynchronous**.

    -   Commands that are added to the **4 specialize** or **6 auditUser passes** configuration pass appear in the setting **Microsoft-Windows-Deployment\\RunSynchronous**.

    -   Commands that are added to the **7 oobeSystem** configuration pass appear in the setting **Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup\\FirstLogonCommands**.

        **Note**  
        If you create a user account that does not include administrative rights, commands that are added to the **7 oobeSystem** configuration pass may not be run. Details are as follows:

        -   If User Account Control is enabled, a dialog box appears when that user logs on for the first time. The dialog box provides an option to allow an administrator to apply the commands. If the user clicks **Cancel**, these commands are not run.

        -   If User Account Control is disabled, these commands are not run.
