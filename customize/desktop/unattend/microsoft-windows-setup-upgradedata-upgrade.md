# Upgrade


`Upgrade` specifies whether the present installation is an upgrade from a previous version of Windows.

Windows Setup does not support using any other unattended Setup settings during upgrades. When you upgrade from an earlier version of Windows, you must create an answer file that includes only the Windows-Setup\\`UpgradeData` settings. Then, you must use either the Windows product DVD or the System Preparation (Sysprep) tool to upgrade Windows.

For a sample answer file, see the [XML Example](#xmlexample) section.

**Caution**  
If you use an installation image that was originally installed by using an Unattend.xml file, and you execute the **Repair in-place upgrade (overwrite installation)** option, the upgrade installation may quit. You may not be able to restart the installation. For more information, see [Knowledge Base Article ID 2425962](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=209802).
