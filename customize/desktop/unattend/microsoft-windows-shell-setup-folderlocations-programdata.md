# ProgramData


`ProgramData` specifies the path to the program-data folder (normally **C:\\ProgramData**). Unlike the **Program Files** folder, this folder can be used by applications to store data for standard users, because it does not require elevated permissions.

**Warning**  
We don’t recommend using this setting, except perhaps in a test environment. The following are known issues:

-   The Windows Store and Windows Store apps are not supported.

-   If you change the default location of the program-data folders to a volume other than the system volume, you cannot service your image. Any updates, fixes, or service packs may not be applied to the installation.

 

The path can be on a volume other than the system drive, as long as it meets the following requirements:

-   It must be on an NTFS volume.

-   It can’t point to a drive that has a different copy of Windows on it.

-   It can’t contain any serviceable components.
