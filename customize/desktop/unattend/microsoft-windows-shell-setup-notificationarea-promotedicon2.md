# PromotedIcon2


`PromotedIcon2` specifies an icon to be shown in the visible system notification area on the taskbar in place of the **Battery** icon.

Up to four system notification icons are shown in the visible portion of the system notification area on the desktop. By default, these icons are **Action Center**, **Battery**—(if the system hardware includes battery support—**Network**, and **Volume**.

By setting the **PromotedIcon2** component, you can select another icon to be visible in the system notification area. This icon will appear in place of the **Battery** icon.

**Note**  
For portable computers, we recommend including a battery indicator that is visible at all times, such as the default **Battery** system notification icon.

 

To select the icon to be visible, you must:

1.  Select an application file that includes a system notification icon. This application file must be signed.

2.  Set both the **Path** and **GUID** elements for the file.

For information about specifying the GUID for your icon, see the MSDN Topic: [NOTIFYICONDATA Structure](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120340).
