# GUID


`GUID` specifies the globally unique identifier (GUID) of an icon to appear in the notification area at the far right of the taskbar.

By setting the [Path](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-notificationarea-promotedicon2-path.md) and GUID elements of the PromotedIcon2 component, you can configure another icon to appear in the notification area. This icon will appear in place of the **Battery** icon.

To select the icon to be visible, you must:

-   Select a signed binary application file that includes a notification icon.

-   Set both the **Path** and **GUID** elements for the file.

The GUID for the icon is contained in the application. The NOTIFYICONDATA shell structure contains the guidItem. For more information, see the MSDN topic: [NOTIFYICONDATA](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120340). For third-party applications, contact your application provider to see if your application uses this structure and to obtain the GUID.
