# ProfilesDirectory


`ProfilesDirectory` specifies the path to the user profile folder (normally **C:\\Users**).

When you use a folder name other than "Users", like `C:\Documents and Settings`, then Windows creates the Users folder on that drive (C:\\Users), and also creates an redirect folder (C:\\Documents and Settings) that points to the Users folder.

## Important usage notes


-   We don’t recommend using this setting, except perhaps in a test environment.

-   When this setting is changed, the Windows Store and Windows Store apps are not supported.

-   **Using drives other than the system drive:**

    Use this setting to move the user-profile folder (typically %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\Users) to another location during deployment. The destination path can be on a volume other than the system drive, as long as it meets the following requirements:

    -   It must be on an NTFS volume.

    -   It can’t point to a drive that has a different copy of Windows on it.

-   Beginning with Windows 10, OS upgrades are supported even if user profiles have been redirected to another drive. For example, if you are using Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 with `ProfilesDirectory` set to D:\\, you can upgrade to Windows 10.

    However, this is not supported when using push-button reset.

-   This setting can be used to keep system data separate from user data. If Windows is re-installed on the system volume, a user with administrative rights can manually recover data from this location.
