# Wi-Fi calling operator name


OEMs can customize the display name for the mobile operator when the device is using Wi-Fi calling.

<a href="" id="constraints---none"></a>**Constraints:** None  
This customization supports: **per-IMSI** value

<a href="" id="instructions-"></a>**Instructions:**  
1.  Create a customization answer file using the contents shown in the following code sample.

    ``` syntax
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
    <ImageCustomizations xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate"  
                         Name="WiFiCallingOperatorName"  
                         Description="Use to customize the mobile operator name that's visible when the phone 
                                      is using Wi-Fi calling."  
                         Owner=""  
                         OwnerType="OEM"> 
      
      <!-- Define the Targets --> 
      <Targets>
         <Target Id="">
            <TargetState>
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
            </TargetState>
         </Target>
      </Targets>
      
      <Static>
        <Settings Path="Multivariant">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="1" />
        </Settings>
        <Settings Path="AutoDataConfig">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="0" />
        </Settings>

        <!-- Add the resource-only dll file and language MUI packages -->
        <Settings Path="Localization/MUI">  
          <!-- Use to add your base MUI DLL file -->
          <Asset Name="BaseDll" Source="" />

          <!-- Use to specify the language MUI packages (*.dll.mui) for the languages you are supporting and have 
               localized strings for -->
          <Asset Name="LanguageDll/$(langid)" Source="" />
          <Asset Name="LanguageDll/$(langid)" Source="" />
          <Asset Name="LanguageDll/$(langid)" Source="" />
          <!-- Add as many as you need -->         
        </Settings>
      </Static>

      <!-- Specify the Variant -->
      <Variant Name=""> 
        <TargetRefs>
          <TargetRef Id="" /> 
        </TargetRefs>

        <Settings Path="Phone/PerSimSettings/$(__IMSI)">  
          <Setting Name="WiFiCallingOperatorName" Value="" />      
        </Settings>  

      </Variant>

    </ImageCustomizations>
    ```

2.  Specify an `Owner`.

3.  Add the resource-only .dll file and the language MUI packages (\*.dll.mui) for the languages you are supporting. To do this, follow these steps:

    1.  Add the resource-only .dll that contains the custom display string by setting the `BaseDll` asset to point to the location of your base MUI DLL file. For example: *C:\\Path\\DisplayStrings.dll*.

    2.  Add the language MUI packages (\*.dll.mui) for all the languages you are supporting and have localized strings for. To do this:

        -   Set the asset's `Name` to `LanguageDll/`*$(langid)* where *$(langid)* corresponds to the language. For example: *LanguageDll/en-US*.

        -   Set the asset's `Source` to the location of the .dll.mui file for that language. For example: *C:\\Path\\en-us\\DisplayStrings.dll.mui*.

        -   Repeat the previous steps for the other languages.

            The following example shows the customization answer file entries for en-US, fr-CA, and es-MX languages:

            ``` syntax
            <Asset Name="LanguageDll/en-US" Source="C:\Path\en-us\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" />
            <Asset Name="LanguageDll/fr-CA" Source="C:\Path\fr-CA\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" />
            <Asset Name="LanguageDll/es-MX" Source="C:\Path\es-MX\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" />
            ```

        For more information, see [Create a resource-only .dll for localized strings](create-a-resource-only-dll-for-localized-strings.md).

4.  For the **per-IMSI** case:

    1.  Define **Targets** or conditions for when a variant can be applied, such as keying off a SIM's MCC, MNC, and SPN.

    2.  Define settings for a **Variant**, which are applied if the associated target's conditions are met.

5.  To customize the name of the mobile operator when the phone is using Wi-Fi calling, you can set the value for `WiFiCallingOperatorName` to:

    -   Use a localized MUI string – To do this, set value to the name of the resource-only .dll file and specify the string offset that corresponds to the mobile operator name. For example: *@DisplayStrings.dll,-Offset*.

    -   Use a non-localized string – To do this, set value to the string that corresponds to the mobile operator name. For example: *Contoso*.

    If you don't set the value for `WiFiCallingOperatorName`, the device will always display "*SIMServiceProviderName* Wi-Fi", where *SIMServiceProviderName* is a string that corresponds to the SPN for the SIM on the device. If the service provider name in the SIM is not set, only "Wi-Fi" will be displayed.

<a href="" id="testing-steps-"></a>**Testing steps:**  
1.  Flash a build containing this customization to a device that has Wi-Fi calling enabled.

2.  If you used a localized MUI string, verify that the localized string for the Wi-Fi calling mobile operator name is displayed on the dialer.

    If you used a non-localized string, verify that this string is displayed on the dialer.

    If you did not set the value, verify that "*SIMServiceProviderName* Wi-Fi" is displayed on the dialer.
