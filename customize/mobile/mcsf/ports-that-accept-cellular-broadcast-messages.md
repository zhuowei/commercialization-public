# Ports that accept cellular broadcast messages


Partners can specify one or more ports from which the device will accept cellular broadcast messages.

<a href="" id="constraints---none"></a>**Constraints:** None  
This customization supports: **per-SIM** value

<a href="" id="instructions-"></a>**Instructions:**  
1.  Create a customization answer file using the contents shown in the following code sample.

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  

    <ImageCustomizations xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate"  
                         Name="SMSCellularBroadcastPorts"  
                         Description="Use to specify one or more ports from which the device will accept cellular broadcast messages."  
                         Owner=""  
                         OwnerType="OEM"> 
      
      <!-- Define the Targets --> 
      <Targets>
         <Target Id="">
            <TargetState>
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
            </TargetState>
         </Target>
      </Targets>
      
      <Static>
        <Settings Path="Multivariant">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="1" />
        </Settings>
        <Settings Path="AutoDataConfig">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="0" />
        </Settings>
      </Static>

      <!-- Specify the Variant -->
      <Variant Name=""> 
        <TargetRefs>
          <TargetRef Id="" /> 
        </TargetRefs>

        <Settings Path="Messaging/PerSimSettings/$(__ICCID)">  
          <Setting Name="BroadcastChannels" Value="" />    
        </Settings>  

      </Variant>

    </ImageCustomizations>
    ```

2.  Specify an `Owner`.

3.  Define **Targets** or conditions for when a variant can be applied, such as keying off a SIM's MCC, MNC, and SPN.

4.  Define settings for a **Variant**, which are applied if the associated target's conditions are met.

5.  Set the `BroadcastChannels` value to the port number(s) that can accept cellular broadcast messages. For example, *1234;5678;9012* and so on.

    If you specify the same port that Windows 10 Mobile already recognizes as an Emergency Alert port (a CMAS or ETWS port number) and a cell broadcast message is received on that port, the user will only receive the message once. The message that is received will be displayed as an Emergency Alert message.
