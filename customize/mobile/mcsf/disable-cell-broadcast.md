# Disable Cell Broadcast


By default, Cell Broadcast (also known as Short Message Service-Cell Broadcast (SMS-CB)) is a feature that is active at all times. Some mobile operators may require OEMs to disable this feature if it is not available for certain areas or zones, or if operators want to get better battery performance by not activating radio functions that may not be needed for a certain market.

To comply with these operator requirements, OEMs may disable Cell Broadcast through an NV item setting in the modem rather than in the OS.

**Note**  
NV items are owned by the IHV and not Microsoft. OEMs should consult with their IHV to determine how to disable Cell Broadcast through an NV item.
