# Maps for phones shipped in China


Microsoft recommends using the new [ChinaVariantWin10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt203640) setting instead of this legacy MCSF setting.

For a Windows mobile device shipping in China, partners must specify that the device is intended for that market by configuring `ChinaVariant` setting. When enabled, maps approved by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping in China are used and the maps are obtained from a server located in China.

This customization may result in different maps, servers, or other configuration changes on the device.

**Note**  
If partners do not set the `ChinaVariant` setting to 1, partners may not ship the device in China.

          <Setting Name="ChinaVariant" Value="" />

    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">

    <td><p>0 or No</p></td>
    <td><p>Disables the feature.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

2.  Launch the maps application and verify that the maps used are the same as those approved by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping in China.
