# Control Panel device icon


OEMs can change the default icon associated with the phone on a connected computer.

When the user connects a phone to a Windows computer, the phone name and icon shows up in the **Devices and Printers** list. OEMs can change the default icon associated with the phone.

**Limitations and restrictions:**

Create an icon to represent the phone that meets the following specifications:

-   **Filename:** Device.ico

-   **Dimensions, bit level and transparency:**

    256x256: 32bit + Alpha

    48x48: 32bit + Alpha

    48x48: 8bit 256

    48x48: 8bit 16

    32x32: 32bit + Alpha

    32x32: 8bit 256

    32x32: 4bit 16

    24x24: 32bit + Alpha

    24x24: 8bit 256

    24x24: 4bit 16

    16x16: 32bit + Alpha

    16x16: 8bit 256

    16x16: 4bit 16

-   Match the orientation and general creative style of the sample image. To avoid issues associated with the localization of the screen image text, the phone image must depict a phone that is turned off.

                         Owner=""  
                         OwnerType="OEM"> 

       <Static>

          <Settings Path="MediaTransferProtocol/DeviceAssets">

             <Asset Name="DeviceIcon" Source="C:\Path\Device.ico" />
