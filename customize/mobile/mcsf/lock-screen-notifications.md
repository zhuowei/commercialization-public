# Lock screen notifications


OEMs can preload apps that support lock screen notifications. Notifications alert the user to new content or updates in that app. They can take the form of a number (to indicate the number of changes) or a text preview.

OEMs can also preset one notification in the fifth slot on the lock screen. This notification displays an icon for a single app plus the number of notifications for that app.

**Limitations and restrictions:**

-   The default count notification mappings must not be changed.

-   The default text notification mapping must not be changed.

-   Notification icons provided by the app and displayed on the lock screen must be monochromatic, with a white foreground color and a transparent background color.

-   After first boot, apps can only be assigned as a lock screen notification by the user; apps must not automatically use a notification slot.

-   Users can delete apps that support notifications, and they can also select alternate notification mappings.

For more information about building an app that supports notifications on the lock screen, see the Windows developer documentation.

**To preload and specify the app that supports lock screen notifications:**

1.  Create a customization answer file using the contents shown in the following code sample.

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
    <ImageCustomizations xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate"  
                         Name="LockScreenNotifications"  
                         Description="Use to preload an app that supports lock screen notifications and set the app to use the 5th slot on the lock screen."  
                         Owner=""  
                         OwnerType="OEM"> 
      
      <Static>  
        <Applications>
          <Application Source=""
                       License=""
                       ProvXML="" />
        </Applications>

        <Settings Path="LockScreen">  
          <Setting Name="LockNotificationAppID" Value="" /> 
          <Setting Name="LockNotificationAppTile" Value="default" />  
        </Settings>  
      </Static>

    </ImageCustomizations>
    ```

2.  Specify an `Owner`.

3.  Preload the app that supports lock screen notifications by specifying these settings:

    -   Set `Source` to the path and name of the app's .xap file.

    -   Set `License` to the path and name of the app's license file.

    -   Set `ProvXML` to the path and name of the app's PROVXML file.

4.  Set the `LockNotificationAppID` setting `Value` to correspond to your app' s app ID or GUID.

5.  Replace the `LockNotificationAppTile` setting `Value` to match the **TokenID** value that was in your app manifest file. If you do not have a **TokenID** specified, set the `Value` to *default*.

<a href="" id="testing-"></a>**Testing:**  
1.  Flash an image that contains this customization to a device.

2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **Lock screen**.

3.  Scroll down and verify that your lock screen notification app now shows as the default app in fifth slot under **Choose apps to show quick status**.
