# Warning about light theme for AMOLED and OLED screens


OEMs can choose to display a warning about battery life if the user selects the light theme on phones with AMOLED or OLED displays. This customization is not relevant for other screen types, as there is not a significant power difference between the themes with the light and dark background.
