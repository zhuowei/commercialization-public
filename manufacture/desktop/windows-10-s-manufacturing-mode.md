# Manufacturing mode

## Overview

Windows 10 S has a manufacturing mode that allows you to run unsigned code when booted into audit mode. This can help on the factory floor when running scripts, installers, and diagnostic tools. You enable manufacturing mode through a registry key that you add to an offline image, and you disable it by removing the registry key from audit mode. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't ship your Windows 10 S PC with the registry in place. Remove the registry key prior to shipping the device.

Before shipping your PC, make sure to remove the registry key from the Windows 10 S PC. You should also make sure that if you've created a recovery package, that the manufacturing registry key is excluded. 

## Enable manufacturing mode

Here's how to enable manufacturing mode.

On your technician PC:

1. Mount your Windows 10 S image

    ```
    Dism /Mount-Wim /WimFile:D:\sources\install.wim /index:1 /MountDir:C:\mount\windows
    ```
    Where D: is your Windows 10 S installation media.

2. Load the SYSTEM registry hive from your mounted image into regedit on your technician PC. We'll use a temporary hive called HKLM\Windows10S.

    ```
	reg load HKLM\Windows10S C:\Mount\Windows\Windows\System32\Config\System
	```

3. Add the manufacturing registry key.

    ```
    reg add HKLM\Windows10S\ControlSet001\Control\CI\Policy /v ManufacturingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1
	```

4. Unload the registry hive from your technician PC.

    ```
    reg unload HKLM\Windows10S
    ```

5. Unmount the image and commit changes.

    ```
    Dism /Unmount-Image /MountDir:"C:\mount\windows" /Commit
    ```

The Windows 10 S image now has the manufacturing key that will allow you to make changes in audit mode.

## Remove the manufacturing registry key

When you're finished making changes to your PC in audit mode, you'll remove the manufacturing registry key. 

While still booted into audit mode:

1. Open Command Prompt.

2. Remove the registry key.

    ```
    reg delete HKLM\system\ControlSet001\Control\CI\Policy /v ManufacturingMode
    ```

The manufacturing registry key is now removed. You can check the Registry Editor to double check that the key has been removed.

On your Windows 10 S PC in audit mode:

1. Open Registry Editor by clicking on the start menu and typing `regedit` and press enter.

2. Use the registry browser in the left pane to navigate to Computer\HKEY\_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\CI\Policy.

3. Under _policy,_ you should not see a key called _manufacturingmode_.

## Exclude the manufacturing registry key from recovery

When you create a recovery package, you want to make sure to exclude the manufacturing registry key. Create an exclusion file that you use with scanstate to capture a recovery package.

1. Create an .xml file in a text editor.

2. Copy and paste the following code. This tells ScanState to not capture the registry key in the recovery package that it creates:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <migration urlid="http://www.microsoft.com/migration/1.0/migxmlext/ExcludeManufacturingMode">
    <component type="System">
        <displayName>Exclude manufacturing regkey</displayName>
            <role role="Settings">
                <rules context="System">
                    <unconditionalExclude>
                        <objectSet>
                            <pattern type="Registry">HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CI\Policy [ManufacturingMode]</pattern>
                        </objectSet>
                    </unconditionalExclude>
                </rules>
            </role>
    </component>
    </migration>
    ```

3. Save the file as exclusion.xml.

4. When you use scanstate to generate a recovery package, add /i:exclusion.xml to the scanstate command to exclude the manufacturing key from the capture. This command creates a recovery package that excludes the manufacturing registry key, and places it into the recovery folder.

    ```
    Scanstate.exe /config:T:\deploymenttools\Config_SettingsOnly.xml /o /v:13 /ppkg C:\Recovery\Customizations\usmt.ppkg /i:exclusion.xml /l:C:\Scanstate.log
    ```
